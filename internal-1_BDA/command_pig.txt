DUMP filtered_records;

Group Records by Year :-
grouped_records = GROUP filtered_records BY year;

Dump Grouped Records :-
DUMP grouped_records;

Calculate Maximum Temperature by Year :-
max_temp = FOREACH grouped_records GENERATE group, MAX(filtered_records.temperature);

Dump Maximum Temperature :-
DUMP max_temp;
